READ ME!

This is an Alpha Build of the project.
There might be some bugs, which I'm fixing

Known Bugs

Enemies can click through the walls. This is due to their collider. 
This rarely happens and is only minor as they get back through the wall again

Level 2 Bugs

Checkpoints do not work
This makes it so the player can't die
