READ ME!

This is an Alpha Build of the project.
There might be some bugs, which I'm fixing

Known Bugs

Enemies can click through the walls. This is due to their collider. 
This rarely happens and is only minor as they get back through the wall again

Level 2's Health Slider doesn't go down
The health does go down, but the slider doesn't work (for some reason, even tho I coded it the way it was in the first Level and that worked fine)
